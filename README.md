# City-Genie
City Genie is a smart, interactive web platform that lets citizens report city hazards like potholes, missing streetlights, and blockages through a live map. With real-time alerts, predictive risk zones, child safety features, and smart helmet integration, it helps make cities safer, faster, and more responsive.
